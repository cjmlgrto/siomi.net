After my more scathing attack on Christmas Day, I felt compelled to write this piece as some sort of salvation. Here I am, trying to prove to you that I do indeed have a heart and a brain - I promise I am not the Grinch. As per usual, I should be doing something else right now. It is 6pm on New Years Eve and like most of us, I have places to go and people to see. However, I have wanted to reflect on the past year and felt like now was a good time to do so.

At work, I find myself doing comparisons for clients. The usual layout is **LOSS -- GAIN -- MAINTAIN**. Given my expertise in assessing other people's lives form this viewpoint, I have decided to use the same approach in analysing 2017.

**LOSS:** I look back on this year and can remember many times of sorrow and sadness. I think it is because I have lost a countless number of things. The final remnants of adolescent innocence has been shaken off. I certainly lost a few friends and acquaintances over the year, although I believe this can be chalked up to the simple fact of our paths in life diverging. I have lost a percentage of body fat, although it is not something I fixate on. I continue to lose hope in humanity. I think this is just how it is as you grow older, more cynical and less idealistic. That said, it still hurts and makes my heart ache.

**GAIN:** A Bachelor's Degree, a full time position in the finance sector, life insurance (to complement my newfound constant awareness of my own mortality), a second-hand 22'' iMac. I have a greater appreciation for my mother (she truly is the best), an ability to lift heavy things and hence an increase in muscle mass, and a penchant for listening to Ja Rule and 50 Cent (then comparing both artists and reading up on the Murder Inc vs. G Unit feud). I have also learned a lot more about different financial instruments and the finance sector in general. It is quite amazing how much information your brain can retain.

**MAINTAIN:** Many materialistic things like my car, books, jewelry, etc. I have generally maintained the same interests and hobbies. This is probably a good time to note that I have also mainted the same overall weight.

It is undeniable for me that it feels good to close this chapter.

Sincerely,

Siomi
