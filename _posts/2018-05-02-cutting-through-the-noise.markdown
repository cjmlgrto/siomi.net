I have recently started following a female commodities trader on Twitter by the name of [@chigrl](http://twitter.com/chigrl). I like her because of her humour, her awareness of how global events impact commodity prices, and her dedication to interacting with other individuals on social media. Essentially, she is everything I aspire to be in 15 years' time. What I like most about @chigrl's tweets are her little nuggets of wisdom that are offered along the way. She discourages grandiose speculative trading. She encourages her followers to face adversity head-on, which is particularly valuable advice if you are a day trader having a bad week. She believes in renewable energy, despite the fact that her work largely revolves around fossil fuels. She is sensible in the way she talks about trading and financial markets. 

This is actually a recurring theme amongst **actual financial professionals** on Twitter. While they are happy to discuss current financial trends, the true professionals do not exist to make outlandish comments. Once you have followed them for a while, you start to pick up on their investment ideology. You are better equipped to differentiate between their offhand comments and actual, prospective trade ideas. That said, it takes time - even moreso for people who do not have a financial background. The best lesson we can learn from these professionals is to differentiate between noise and truth. By no means do I claim to have mastered this art, but following such professionals on Twitter has helped shift my perception on what information truly matters when investing. 

We all have our own investment style. We all have particular securities or funds that we have a soft spot for. Some people love domestic equities, while others search for the most outlandish thing they can find (the [iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF is worth mentioning](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239502/ishares-us-aerospace-defense-etf)). Some people listen to podcasts about what Warren Buffett thinks. Others prefer to invest in the S&P500 and wait 20 years. 

If you are an investor, a valuable thing you can do is learn to identify what your goals are. From there, you can read or listen to what the professionals (who are aligned with your investment methodology) have to say. There is always a lot of talk about "noise" in financial markets, but if you want to cut through it, you have to know what is noise (and who is making it!) and what morsels of wisdom actually matter to you. 


Sincerely,
Siomi
