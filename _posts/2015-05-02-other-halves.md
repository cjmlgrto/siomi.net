You’re not supposed to hear these sorts of things from these sorts of people. Things have gone well for those chosen to speak at conferences like XOXO: credibility, attention, success—whatever brass ring a person might want to reach for—they’ve got it. They are them, and they are great, so why the hang ups?

After several talks, an unstated theme began to emerge, providing fuel for many of the stories and ideas expressed throughout the two days. It was often hinted upon, but only directly stated in [Christina Xu](https://twitter.com/xuhulk)’s talk. It came out as bright and searing as magnified daylight: “Independence is lonely.”

I winced, the kind of expression you make when you have to live with bad news. I know that loneliness. So, I looked around to see if anyone else was making grotesque faces of recognition. I saw a lot of nodding, as if to say, “I accept this as an interesting and possibly true idea.” Maybe that’s what normal people do. I was, on the other hand, slowly losing my shit, and contorting my saggy, sad face like a partially deflated balloon, because on one hand, I now had words for that feeling, and knew it wasn’t just me, but on the other hand, it was a sad thought, and a cost I didn’t want to believe was necessary. Still, I tried to keep it together, collect the sad sags of my face-balloon, and put on my deep-in-thought face.

Maybe everyone else was doing the same thing. I couldn’t tell. Holding yourself together is a weird sort of performance, the kind of thing that makes you feel lonely in the first place, even if you’re all together in the same room, feeling the same thing. You want to believe it, but you just can’t be sure.

I wrote “INDEPENDENCE IS LONELY” in my notebook and underlined it. I didn’t mention it to anyone, and hoped they didn’t see my sad, saggy face.

[Hugh Mac­Leod](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/771783-the-price-of-being-a-sheep-is-boredom-the-price) says the price of being a sheep is boredom, and the price being a wolf is loneliness. My experience as a wolf says he’s right, but I think it’s bullshit, so I am writing this. There are lone wolves, but wolves are also pack animals, so how do you reconcile the two? How can we be independent together?

XOXO’s talks had a deep undercurrent of mental health: dealing with stress, depression, [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), and doubt. Emotions are good, especially when aired, and [stress can be beneficial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress), but they are not meant to derail you. If the best, brightest, most talented and successful people we have in the independent community are feeling this way, clearly we have some corrosive expectations of ourselves and one another, and things need to change. We have a climate problem with personal consequences.

So, here are a few critical questions I’ve been asking myself:

How do we create a cultural awareness that attention doesn’t necessarily mean money? People assume that because they’ve heard of you, you are raking it in. That mix up seems to create a lot of pain. You could fill a book with internet celebrities in poverty. Jack Conte of Pomplamoose did some math on stage, and said that a YouTube music video with 400k views would net the artist about $25. In this case, what’s the difference between YouTube and a dastardly music label? The fact that they’re willing to “sign” anyone, because it costs them next to nothing to do so?
