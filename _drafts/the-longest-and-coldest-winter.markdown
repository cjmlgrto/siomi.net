Everybody marvels at how we haven't received much rain. At least we're not like Sydney, they say. We haven't suffered floods after floods in the Summertime and torrential downpours in Winter. 

I haven't noticed the lack of rain. I've been too busy fixated on the cold and my suffering. My anaemic and depressed self who is bone-chillingly cold all the time. A new home to call my own, with brick veneer and barely any insulation and a 30-year old gas ducted heating system that no longer lights. Morning walks to the train station to commute to work where I can't feel my fingers. I haven't noticed the lack of rain or lack of need for an umbrella. I've been too busy sitting inside at a desk, sitting on my couch, laying in my bed. 

My mother always hated Winter time. She was a Summer girl through and through: 0 SPF coconut-scented tanning oil, black string bikinis, sea salt hair texturising spray. A diet of mint chip ice cream, green cordial, watermelon and cantaloupe. Driving in her convertible with the top down, going for walks along the beach, swimming in any suitable bodies of water. Her summer uniform consisted of sunglasses, Havaianas, t-shirts and an impressive collection of cargo skirts. She had the sun damage (and one skin cancer!) to prove it. 

May 16th marked the beginning of the longest and coldest Winter, and every season thereafter would be one without her. I lost my Summer girl.
