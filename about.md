I am passionate about financial literacy and entrepreneurship. I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Finance and Economics, and currently work within the Financial Planning sector. In my spare time, I sit on the Enterprise Academy Advisory Board at my alma mater, Mentone Girlsâ€™ Grammar School. I love technology, books, cars and punk rock. Occasionally I lift weights.
