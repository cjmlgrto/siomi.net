This speed round is in honour of me simultaneously having nothing and so much to say. I must attribute credit for the speed round to the OG speed-rounder, Jared Dillian.

It has been close to five and a half years since I embarked on my last trip. I am now getting to the point where it is a personal challenge to see how much longer I can last without throwing in the towel, proclaiming "I need a break!" and actually taking one. This final part is important: I have had many moments where I have complained that life is too hard and I need to temporarily tap out, but I have not done anything about it. Partly due to complacency and being comfortable, partly due to me being a cheap f**k who avoids spending lots of money, partly due to the aforementioned 'challenge', partly due to my own indecision (What would I do? Where would I go? Who would I go with?), partly due to feeling guilty for not living up to my quest of being an Energizer bunny. See, I come from a long line of people who just do not take holidays. It is a tough mould to break. 

I have never been good at running. There is a lot of internal childhood trauma associated with primary school cross-country competitions. I remember Hamish Blake writing about it one time - how he faked having asthma, or something like that, so he did not have to compete in the dreaded race. Recently, though, I have decided there is no time like the present to try and learn something new, so here I am attempting to run a measly 5km. 

My newest and most favourite technique for dealing with stiff, somewhat awkward and somewhat impersonal social situations is to just keep talking. It does not bother me all that much if I am perceived as being someone who never shuts up. I figured this is better than having to endure those deafening silences in conversation. I feel for all the Uber drivers who have been subjected to my late night ramblings about the price of gold, the battle along the Indian-Pakistani border, and the global slowdown in economic growth as a result of this new tactic of mine.

I am thinking of trying out a new investment strategy. Something to run alongside my IDPS account, something independent of mutual funds. Call it "Steph's attempt in portfolio management". I have some nice correlation matrices, some historical data, some Excel graphs and calculations. There is no time like the present.
