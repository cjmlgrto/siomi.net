There is a very popular method of goal setting referred to as the **[SMART](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php)**[ criteria](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php). Originally pioneered by George T. Doran in the 1980s, the **SMART** method was drilled into me at university. The criteria are as follows:

**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ssignable, **R**ealistic, **T**ime-related.

Perhaps the reason why New Year's resolutions are so popular is because they lend themselves to the **T** in **SMART**. Although the first of January is an arbitrary date like any other within a year, it is a clean signpost that one can measure their progress from. I have a friend who vehemently despises New Year's resolutions. His belief is that if you want to make a change in your life, you should not wait until the new year to do so. I can empathise with him, yet I also think we have been conditioned to perceive a new year as a new chapter, and hence resolutions have grown in popularity. I am going to document my own goals for 2018 below. This post is for my dear friend - hi, JP!

1. Watch my language. I personally believe I swear too much, and I feel like I have gotten lazy with my pronunciation of words in every day conversation. In 2018, I would like to be more mindful of the way I speak (in both vocabulary and tone!).

2. Withhold judgement. According to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, I am an INTJ. My 'J' (judgement) is particularly dominant (rather than 'perception'). While I rarely verbalise this judgement, the amount of internalised judgement occurring within me is probably at an unhealthy level. I think this is something I need to work on.

3. Solidify where I stand politically. There are many political issues of which I have views that are purely based on emotion. This is strange considering I am quite a logical person. This year, I would like to read into political issues more, understand the motivation and policies behind what governments do, and decide where I stand on such issues.

4. Reconnect with my hobbies. While I am quite devoted to my time at the gym, I would like to cook more, watch more documentaries, and read more books. It is likely that I will need to schedule in specific times in my diary for each hobby.

5. Take care of myself more. I am already an introverted person and I enjoy my own company - if anything I think I am already very self-indulgent! That said, in 2018 I would like to look after myself mentally, physically, and emotionally. Maybe I will practice meditation or positive self-talk. I am yet to figure this out 100%, but I will try to learn.

6. Call out people if they are wrong and stand up for myself. This may be in situations where I feel like I am being disrespected,  or if people are having a discussion that is floating ideas that are not fair to a particular group of people. I know the term "social justice warrior" gets thrown around a lot, but I think we all owe each other a bit more respect, and some people do not seem to know what that means. They need to be taught. I am their teacher.

I do realise that not all these goals are **SMART**, but the simple act of putting my list online may help me stay accountable!

Sincerely,

Siomi
