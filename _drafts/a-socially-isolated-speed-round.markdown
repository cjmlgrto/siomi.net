I am not going to talk about coronavirus, because every single person on earth with a platform to voice their opinions is doing so. I have been staying home 95% of the time, occasionally running out to get some food or soap from the supermarket. My hobbies now include long solitary walks, playing the Sims 4, watercolouring, and eating the same sandwich every day.

Last night, I was complaining about how this state-mandated social isolation is impeding on my freedom, and is hence anti-capitalist behaviour, and that I would not like to live under a communist regime, thank you very much. Unfortunately my boyfriend was on the receiving end of this discussion. He argued that social isolation was only impeding on my physical, social mobility, and not on my economic mobility. His argument was that communism would impact physical, social mobility and economic mobility. However, he could not think of any examples of the opposite - physical, social mobility, without economic mobility. I am of the belief that this does not exist. Perhaps under a benevolent dictatorship this may be the case, but isn't that less about communism and more about fascism? Hey, I am not a sociologist. 

Lately I have been so delusional, under self-inflicted house arrest, that I have started yearning for what I call "the good old days". The days where I used to wake up, go to the gym, eat lunch, have an afternoon nap, grab a coffee on my way to work, leave the office at 1am, fall asleep in the dead of the night, and repeat the next day. I miss night shifts, watching the Fed's interest rate statements in real time, sleeping til 5pm, eating spaghetti bolognese.
