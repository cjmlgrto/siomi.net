Sometimes a rose can grow out of bullshit.

Donald Rumsfeld, as terrible as he is, said one good thing in his life. Of course, he used this one good thing to obfuscate the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but we’ll offer him a momentary pass for providing a concise framework of knowledge.

He said there are things you know and things you don’t. Sometimes you are aware of your ignorance and knowledge, other times you are not. This means that there are known knowns (the knowledge you know you have), known unknowns (your awareness of your blind spots), unknown unknowns (you are oblivious to that knowledge), and unknown knowns (the subconscious—that native knowledge you take for granted).

This is a useful map for me today, because I want to talk about designing with an open mind—having a greater imagination about what we do from day to day. We make a lot of assumptions about the design profession, and only over the past few months I’ve begun to realize how uncomfortable these assumptions make me. So, I’ve been dragging the deep, dark lake of my unknown knowns to see what gets dredged up from the bottom. I’m searching for methods to explain a different way of seeing. I’d like to share some of my findings with you today. Maybe you’ll agree with a few of my ideas. If so, you can put them in your pocket to take with you as you set out into the world.

I’m not the first guy to be made uncomfortable by the thoughts stuck in his head. It’s a problem as old as time: person has thinky thought, then person is scared or at least unsettled by the thought of that thinky thought. Case in point: the ancient Greek philosopher Meno. Meno had a question he couldn’t get out of his head:

> “How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you?”

In other words, how can we truly know what we need if we don’t have it? Especially if what we need is foreign and we’ve never had it? So much of what we desire is augmenting ourselves with new material. Love, wisdom, grace, inspiration—these are all extensions of the self in relation to an other. What we need most is to grow out from our core, but this is also the most difficult process to explain how to begin. Meno has lobbed a monster of an open-ended question: how can you find what you don’t know?
