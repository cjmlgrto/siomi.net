This speed round is in honour of me simultaneously having nothing and so much to say. I must attribute credit for the speed round to the OG speed-rounder, Jared Dillian.

It has been close to five and a half years since I embarked on my last trip. I am now getting to the point where it is a personal challenge to see how much longer I can last without throwing in the towel, proclaiming "I need a break!" and actually taking one. This final part is important: I have had many moments where I have complained that life is too hard and I need to temporarily tap out, but I have not done anything about it. Partly due to complacency and being comfortable, partly due to me being a cheap f**k who avoids spending lots of money, partly due to the aforementioned 'challenge', partly due to my own indecision (What would I do? Where would I go? Who would I go with?), partly due to feeling guilty for not living up to my quest of being an Energizer bunny. See, I come from a long line of people who just do not take holidays. It is a tough mould to break.
