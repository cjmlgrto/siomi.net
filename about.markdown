Welcome to my small square of the internet!

I am a Bachelor of Commerce graduate who majored in Finance and Economics. I  am now a trader at a quantitative macro fund. In my spare time, I sit on the [Enterprise Academy Advisory Board](https://ea.mentonegirls.vic.edu.au) at my alma mater, [Mentone Girls' Grammar School](http://mentonegirls.vic.edu.au). I like technology, books, cars, fashion (sometimes), high-end timepieces, lifting weights, punk rock, sleeping,  eating, and rapping along to Ja Rule, among many other things.
