Hello everybody!

I thought it would be fitting to begin my blog with a list of my current holdings. While I anticipate I will be adjusting my portfolio in the near future, I think the simple act of documenting my investment decisions will be an opportunity for me to track how far I've come and identify any trends in my investment behaviour.

I hold my managed and index funds within the North platform. The reasoning behind using North is that it has an excellent range of investments (over 400 if I remember correctly!) and is relatively low cost compared to other similar environments. I also have a CommSec account but I am not actively trading at the moment.
