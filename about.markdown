Welcome to my small square of the internet!

I am a young financial professional working as a trader at a quantitative macro hedge fund. In my spare time, I sit on the [Enterprise Academy Advisory Board](https://ea.mentonegirls.vic.edu.au) at my alma mater, [Mentone Girls' Grammar School](http://mentonegirls.vic.edu.au). I like technology, books, cars, timepieces, lifting weights, swimming laps, and punk rock, among many other things.
