Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am passionate about financial and economic literacy. I recently completed my Bachelor of Commerce at Monash University, where I majored in both Finance and Economics. I currently work within the Financial Planning sector. In my spare time, I sit on the [Enterprise Academy Advisory Board](https://ea.mentonegirls.vic.edu.au) at my alma mater, [Mentone Girls' Grammar School](http://mentonegirls.vic.edu.au). I love technology, books, cars and punk rock. I also lift weights.
