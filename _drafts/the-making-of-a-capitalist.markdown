National security has always been a topic that piques my interest. I guess this is how it is when you grow up in an era of wars against strange, non-State actors like al Qaeda and ISIS. Media saturation of what's happening in the middle east, etc. I recently read a book by Amaryllis Fox called XYZ. Having read one of the chapters online, I had high expectations, but was left feeling a bit ill at the whimsical tone - "stopping the bad guys", "relating to terrorists on a human level", US imperialistic tendencies. I wanted to vomit. My 16 year old self would have certainly vomited. Similar situation when reading "class of 9/11".
- American imperialism; the realisation that the heroes can be the bad guys too. VCE global politics. Ping pong diplomacy, the emergence of the Taliban, 9/11, Abu ghraib, guantanamo, Bush Jr., 
- Teenage communism. A manifestation of the dreaded teenage superiority complex. Me and my intellectual friends, reading Karl Marx, buying second-hand books titled 'communist states at the crossroads' and 'managing non-proliferation regimes in the 1990s'. Teenage rebellion against my capitalist forefathers, who tied their identity to the fact that they lived on the 'Greek side'. God forbid they were from true yugoslavia, where females were seen as equals and education was widespread, state-sanctioned!
- University, a taste of real economics. Demand and supply. The impact of price floors and price ceilings. Dead weight loss. Wage gaps. Tariffs. Trade not being a zero-sum game. Competitive and comparative advantage.
- The finance industry. Using money to make money, insane intricacies of markets. Are capital and money markets an elite club? Are we trying to keep people out, or is it just beyond the lay man's comprehension? Is it up to us to try and make things palatable for Joe down the street, if he cannot fully grasp the concept and has no interest in understanding?
