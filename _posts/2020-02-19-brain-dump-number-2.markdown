It has been a little while since I put my thoughts down here. Admittedly, I have been meaning to do so, but life gets in the way. 

I had a terrible cold that knocked me out for a fortnight. It was a reminder of how badly I tolerate sleeping pills.

Let us talk about coronavirus real quick. I am not here to beat a dead horse, but it has been on my mind, and I would be doing myself a disservice if I did not bring it up. The creative director of a popular Australian women's fashion label posted a meme on her Instagram stories when the hysteria around the virus was at its peak. It was something to do with having to wear a HAZMAT suit when picking up Chinese take-out food. This is wrong on a few levels. Firstly, it is incredibly racist and promotes the vilification and isolation of an entire ethnic community. Given the number of Chinese businesses in Melbourne reporting decreased revenues as of late, this is not an insignificant issue. There are tangible effects being felt by the Chinese community as a result of the fear and misinformation peddled by the mainstream media regarding the virus, and this is likely to have a longer lasting impact. Secondly, how stupid must you be to denigrate an entire race of people who are an integral part of your business? Where are all your clothes made? What does the tag say? "Made in China"? Not to mention the masses of Asian consumers who may have seen the post and have now vowed to not purchase any of the brand's products. Sigh. 


Jamiroquai's 'A Funk Odyssey' is a brilliant album. It has been a good 10 years since I listened to it in full. I am ashamed to have forgotten about it for so long.


I have had a lot of opportunities for self reflection and personal growth over the last 12 months. Sure, big events can have big impacts on your life, but recently I had a small encounter that left a huge impact on me personally. A good one - which I am so grateful for, as there have been a lot of terrible things occurring of which I am forced to find the silver lining. Basically, in the most unlikely of scenarios, I met a lovely woman who has lead a rather extraordinary life. She was my Airbnb host, but she is also a holder of an Order of Australia Medal, a survivor of the Black Saturday bushfires, a widower and a farmer. She was one of the kindest and most inspiring people I have spoken to in a long time, even though our most involved conversation only lasted for an hour. I am so glad my paths crossed with her.

On a related note, I now have maybe 2-3 kilograms of grapefruit in my fridge, so I must find something to do with it. I have never made marmalade before, but I think it will be the most efficient way to use a bulk amount of the fruit.

I am one of the most calculated shoppers you will ever meet. I derive joy in bargain hunting! I also love watching people like Jordan Page on YouTube, mostly because she is so thrifty.  Unfortunately, this manifests in other parts of my life... namely, INVESTING. I have decided to bite the bullet and try purchase a gold ETF. I have a gold miner in my portfolio, but it has not performed as well as I would have liked, hence the desire for the ETF. I think my limit order price is a bit ambitious (hovering around the 3 month low), especially given I would prefer to buy sooner rather than later. I have increased my price with the intention of letting the order run for a week. If things continue to move away from me, I will reevaluate and see whether I should bite the bullet and submit a market order, or wait for another low. There is nothing complex about what I am trying to do here, but writing it down makes me feel more accountable. 

Time to sign off.


Sincerely,

Siomi
