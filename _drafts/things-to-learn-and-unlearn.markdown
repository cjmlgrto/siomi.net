- Charts when trading - why do i never use cjharts anymore? when was the last time i willingly generated a live market chart? all i look at now is the limit order book

It's a Thursday night and I'm here because I've guilted myself into typing words onto the screen. 2 months sitting in the drafts is better than letting this sit any second longer, right? Recent times have been a lesson in distortion,  in a chaotic breakdown of everything familiar, and everything we thought we knew. The disappointment when you find out an acquaintance believes in some new world order, or when the price of frozen berries rises from $4 to $5 in a matter of weeks. Welcome to the new normal.

I had a moment last week where I found myself hyperventilating into a paper bag that had previously been filled with dried apricots. That kind of experience needs no introduction. We all know how tiring, stressful and all-consuming it is to be functioning in society right now. Regardless, it was a timely reminder to step back and **unlearn**. Detach from ego. Remove yourself from the high horse. Stop rolling your eyes into the back of your head when you're faced with something totally ludicrous. Breathe!

Here we are, things to learn and unlearn.
